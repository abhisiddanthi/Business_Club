					<p>
                        In 2007, the World Bank provided Tanzania the financial and technical means to urbanize
						water resource management. Raising a number close to a whopping $1.42 billion, the
                        project can best be described as an abysmal failure, with the percentage of Tanzanians
                        having access to drinking water decreasing in five years since the implementation of the
                        project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Developing nations tend to dream big and for some nations, like Tanzania, an East African
                        country known for its vast wilderness area, the most ambitious dream possible is that of
                        dispelling the image of being a “Third World nation” and emerging as a middle-income
                        country. Despite its efforts, the 50 year old organization failed to fulfill the seemingly
                        straightforward quest for water, which presently requires a four kilometer long trip. On the
                        other end of the spectrum, we will also see successful programs of economic liberalisation
                        that have helped countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong achieve exponential success.
                        They have grown to become nations on par with developed nations while having been as
                        poor as the countries that needed World Bank loans 30 years ago. In this article, after
                        delving into a bit of relevant history, we will try to provide an insight on why despite having
                        the resources, the World Bank has been unable to create the lasting impression of uplifting
                        countries entrenched in poverty, the very vision with which it was forged.
                    </p>                  
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How the World Bank came into existence </h2>
                    <p>
                       At the end of the World War II, countries needed capital to fulfil their ambitions of rapid
                       industrialization and development. This need for capital sparked the establishment of the
                       World Bank, at Bretton Woods. Their first major employment of capital occurred during the
                       Decolonization period of 1947-1968. A substantial chunk of the capital was used towards
                       the development of income-producing infrastructure, such as seaports, highway systems,
                       and power plants, which would help the borrower country repay the loan. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      In 1968, Robert McNamara was appointed to the presidency. During the McNamara Period
                      of 1968-1980, the World Bank’s focus shifted towards the service sector, with the intention
                      of alleviating poverty. The service sector in these borrower countries lacked expertise and
                      social capital. As a result, the implemented projects failed to make any notable impact. The
                      wavering focus of the World Bank not only led to an exponential rise in third-world debt,
                      but it was a rather costly affair that can best be described by the “Cart before the horse”
                      fallacy. The capital investment should have been made at a time when the service sector
                      was adequately equipped to produce maximum gain. The debt increased and these
                      countries were forced to take further loans, accentuating a problem created by the World
                      Bank itself.

                    </p>
                    <p>
					In addition to this appalling mismanagement of funds, the World Bank faces criticism, and
rightfully so, over four key issues: -
             <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp i) Power distribution
          	 <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ii) Structural Measures
             <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp iii) Sovereign Immunity
		     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp iv) Planning and Implementation

                    </p> 
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Power distribution</h2>                    
                    <p>
                        There has been inequitable distribution of voting power ever since the inception of the World Bank. The World Bank system amounts to $1 = 1 vote. Therefore, richer countries often tend to decide how the developing nations carry out their developmental process, while they only contribute 14% to the world’s population.      
                    </p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Sovereign Immunity</h2>  
                    <p>
                       The World Bank faces has sovereign immunity from all member countries. This leads to moral injustice as it is not accountable to its members and does not have a binding obligation to work in their best interests.
                    </p>
					
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Structural Measures</h2>                    
                    <p>
                  The structural measures are arguably the main reasons for the astronomical rise in the
                  levels of third-world debt. Delving into why these measures were so catastrophic-
                    </p>              
						<ol>
						<li><b>Development of exports :</b>
						<p>The development of exports was encouraged mainly to
                           empower these borrower countries to procure the foreign currency needed to repay
                           the debt. This led to them, to put it simply, reduce food crops for local population, to
                           specialize in one or several export crops.
 </p>
						</li>
						<li><b>The complete opening up of markets through elimination of customs barriers :</b>
						<p>The opening up of markets matched untrained, less well equipped local producers
                           against multinational conglomerates, hampering their livelihood.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>The massive privatization of public companies  : </b>
						<p>The massive privatization of public
                           companies involved selling them off for a song. As a result, the state lost control of
                           strategic elements for development and essential services were entrusted to the
                           private sector. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Planning and implementation</h2> 
                    <p>
                      The World Bank, just like they did in Nigeria, already has another loan in place in
                      Tanzania, having forgotten all about the $1.42 billion laid to waste. Up to 1.9 million
                      Tanzanian citizens apparently stand to benefit from new financing approved on 29th
                      January 2017 by the World Bank towards the nation’s Water sector, including 700,000
                      residents of the country’s largest city, Dar es Salaam. The World Bank has a very poor 
                      implementation record in terms of helping developing countries and has in fact been
                      criticized of extending funds and support with the motive of simply extending its geopolitical
                      presence in these regions. Most World Bank investments do not require evictions or
                      damage people’s ability to earn a living - following the Bank’s promise of “doing no harm”.
                      But the percentage of those that do has increased sharply in recent years.

                    </p>
					<p>In the case of Nigeria, a World Bank sanctioned project aimed at improving drainage
                       systems and income producing infrastructure such as dams and power plants led to the
                       eviction of over 9,000 residents of Lagos, without resettlement. The investigation reports
                       have found that the bank’s lapses have hurt urban slum dwellers, hardscrabble farmers,
                       impoverished fisherfolk and forest dwellers — leaving them to fight for their homes, their
                       land and their ways of life, sometimes in the face of intimidation and violence. Despite this,
                       the subsequent loan was sanctioned.
					</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Hong Kong </h2> 
                    <p>
                     Hong Kong, which was considered to be a part of the economically barren Asia only received
a small amount of aid from America. They began a series of economic liberalizations in
1965, covering a vast number of sectors, especially banking and financial services.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a.&nbsp&nbsp<i><b style="font-size:22px;">Lowering Barriers to International Trade :</b></i>
                      The Government came up with &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp innovative ideas such as setting “Free trade zones” that allowed for easier exports, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fuelling growth.
                    </p>
					<p style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b.&nbsp&nbsp<i><b style="font-size:22px;">Reformed Tax Structure : </b></i>
                     Following a capitalist school of thought, a fixed tax slab of 20 percent was levied on income over $155,000, with the worker being taxed an average of only 2 percent. 
					</p>
					<p>GDP soon skyrocketed, with numbers like 9% growth common. According to current prices,
                       Hong Kong is one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, while being a
                       major global financial hub. The rise has truly been phenomenal. All without the aid of the
                       World Bank, by carefully thought out series of economic liberalizations.

                     After exhausting its quota of World Bank loans, Singapore followed the path that Hong Kong
                     had paved for the rest of the world to follow. The country focussed on enhancing export
                     numbers and boosting foreign investment in the country. The tax system was restructured,
                     the average person was taxed close to zero while the rich were taxed thirty percent. The
                     country’s policy of not differentiating between domestic and foreign firms played a crucial
                     role in securing foreign investment.
                     These economic reforms helped pave way for these countries on their upward trajectory.

					<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion </h2>
                    <p>
                   Since 1944, the World Bank has spent hundreds of billions and has outstanding debt due to
                   the financing of non-performing assets by taking further loans, which could easily lead to a
                   vicious, perpetual debt trap. Most beneficiaries of loans aren’t in a better position than
                   before. In fact, many are worse off. Even though 1.42 billion was spent in Tanzania, little to
                   no improvement was observed. The world organization has failed to improvise over time,
                   replicating its past mistakes. It has provided loans without proper groundwork or without
                   thought of the impact on the local communities. It is important to remember that rapid
                   growth is possible only when there is economic freedom, such as there was in Hong Kong
                   and Singapore. In order for World Bank initiatives to be effective, the country in focus must
                   be given a bigger say in determining the execution, keeping in mind the viability and the
                   possible gains.
