                    <p><b>What is Inventory Management?</b></p>
                    <p>Inventory management refers to the process of ordering, storing, using, and selling a
                        company's inventory. This includes managing raw materials, components, and finished
                        products, as well as warehousing and processing of such items.
                        </p>
                    <p>Let’s try to understand the process of Inventory Management:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Pics/Screenshot 2024-10-14 183117.png" width="100%"/></p>
                    
                    <p><b>Types of Inventory Management Methods:</b></p>
                    <p>A corporation will employ various inventory management techniques depending on the kind
                        of business or product being examined. The four most popular techniques for analysing
                        inventory are as follows:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li> <b>Just-in-Time(JIT) Management -</b> This type of inventory management calls for close
                            coordination with suppliers to ensure that raw materials arrive at the exact time when
                            manufacturing is supposed to start, but no earlier. The objective is to keep just enough
                            inventory on hand to meet demand. Apple is one of the top companies that applies JIT
                            inventory management. It has only one central warehouse in the US and about 150
                            key suppliers worldwide; it has developed strong and strategic relationships with its
                            vendors. This outsourcing of production made Apple leaner and resulted in slashing
                            costs and reducing overstock. The major risk associated with JIT management arises
                            in case of a sudden increase in demand, as the supplier won’t be able to match it.
                            </li>
                        <li><b>Materials Requirement Planning(MRP) -</b> By calculating the required raw materials,
                            components, and subassemblies, as well as the timing of the final assembly step
                            based on demand and the bill of materials (BOM), an MRP system streamlines the
                            manufacturing production process. Through this approach, we aim to provide answers
                            to three questions: what inventory is required, how much is required, and by when?
                            This technique depends on accurate sales forecasts; thus, manufacturers must have
                            up-to-date sales data in order to anticipate their inventory needs accurately. MRP is
                            useful in both discrete manufacturing, such as for bolts, subassemblies, or
                            automobiles, and process manufacturing, including chemicals, soft drinks, and
                            detergent.
                            </li>
                        <li> <b>Economic Order Quantity(EOQ) -</b> This model is implemented by calculating the
                            number of units a company should add to its inventory with each batch order to reduce
                            the total costs of its inventory while assuming constant consumer demand. The
                            holding and setup expenses for inventory are also included. The EOQ model works to
                            make sure that the appropriate amount of inventory is ordered per batch so that a
                            company does not have to place orders too frequently or have an excess of inventory
                            on hand. McDonald’s Corporation uses the EOQ model to determine the most optimal
                            order quantity and minimal costs while ordering materials and products or developing
                            the system of producing the brand’s foods.
                            </li>
                        <li><b>Days Sales of Inventory (DSI) -</b> This is a financial ratio that shows the typical number
                            of days it takes a business to convert its inventory, which includes finished goods, into
                            sales. DSI can be understood in a variety of ways and is sometimes referred to as the
                            average age of inventory, days inventory outstanding (DIO), days in inventory (DII),
                            days sales in inventory, or days inventory. Additionally, products that are regarded as
                            "works in progress" (WIP) are counted in the inventory. The number indicates the
                            inventory's liquidity and how long the current stock of an organisation's inventory will
                            survive.
                            <p><b>DSI = (Average inventory /Cost of goods sold) x 365</b></p>     
                            <p>For example, Fresh Supermarket is going to work out its DSI for the past 12 months.
                                The Average Inventory value for this period was $20,000, and the Cost of Goods Sold
                                (COGS) was $150,000, so the calculation for DSI is 20,000/150,000 x 365 = 48.7.
                                </p>                       
                            </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><b>Little's Law:</b></p>
                    <p>Little's Law is a fundamental concept in supply chain management that helps optimise inventory levels. It states that:</p>
                    <p><b>Inventory (I) = Flow Rate (R) * Flow Time (T)</b></p>
                    <p>By understanding the flow rate and flow time, the supply chain can ensure efficient product movement from suppliers to distribution centres and finally to customers' doors.</p>

                    <p>In the context of a consumer goods or quick commerce supply chain, this means that:</p>
                        <p><b>Inventory:</b> Represents the number of products waiting to be sold or delivered.</p>
                        <p><b>Flow Rate:</b> Indicates the rate at which products are sold or delivered to customers.</p>
                        <p><b>Flow Time:</b> Refers to the time a product spends in the supply chain from order placement to delivery.</p>
                        
                    <p><b>Example:</b> If you have 250 orders to process (inventory), you can handle 50 orders per day (flow rate), then it will take you 5 days (flow time) to clear the backlog.</p>
                    <p><b>Macroeconomics </b>deals in aggregate economic variables such as growth rate of national output, interest rates, unemployment, and inflation. It is called a top down approach as we start by looking at the large picture (the entire economies).</p>

                    <p><b>Inventory Turns: </b>Inventory turnover is crucial for profitability. It measures how many times a
                        company's inventory is sold or used in a given period. Maintaining a high inventory turnover
                        helps quick commerce companies reduce storage costs and ensure fresh and in-demand
                        products are readily available for delivery.</p>
                    <p><b>Inventory Turns = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory</b></p>
                    <p>In a consumer goods or quick commerce supply chain, high inventory turnover indicates
                        efficient operations, as products move quickly from suppliers to customers.
                        </p>
                    
                    <p><b>ABC Analysis:</b> ABC analysis helps prioritise inventory management by categorising products
                        based on their importance. In this approach:</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Class A Items:</b> These are the most important products, often the top 20% in terms of value
                        or demand. Focus on optimising these.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Class B Items:</b> : These products make up the middle 30-35% in terms of value or demand.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Class C Items:</b> These are the less critical products, typically the remaining 45-50%.
                        In a consumer goods supply chain, Class A items might include popular and high-demand
                        products, while Class C items could be seasonal or low-demand items.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Prioritising Class A items ensures that popular and high-value products are always in stock,
                        while Class C items may be ordered on demand, reducing excess inventory and costs.                  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><b>Role of AI in Inventory Management</b></p>

                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making waves in how companies handle their inventory. Take
                        Amazon, for instance – they've fully embraced AI in their inventory game. In a nutshell, they
                        use smart computer programs to make educated guesses about what people will buy. This
                        helps them avoid having too much or too little of a product in their warehouses. It's like
                        hitting the bullseye. This saves them money and keeps customers happy because they
                        usually have what we're looking for. AI also helps them plan efficient shipping and keeps our
                        orders safe. Amazon's use of AI in inventory management shows us that it's not just a tech
                        thing – it's about saving money, making things run smoother, and keeping customers
                        satisfied when they shop.</p>

                    <p>Some of the key benefits of using AI in inventory management include:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li> Improved forecasting accuracy</li>
                        <li> Reduced lead times</li>
                        <li> Automated reorder points</li>
                        <li> Optimised warehouse layouts</li>
                        <li> Supplier and vendor management</li>
                        <li> Quality control and defect detection</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><b>Predictive Analysis: Forecasting demand</b></p>

                    <p>Inventory management strategies need to adapt to demand variability to ensure efficient
                        operations and minimise stockouts or excess inventory. Here are a few approaches to
                        handle demand variability in inventory management:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Safety Stock: Safety stock is a buffer quantity of inventory maintained to mitigate
                            uncertainties in demand. By setting appropriate safety stock levels, you can account
                            for demand variability and reduce the risk of stockouts. The safety stock can be
                            determined based on factors such as desired service level, lead time variability, and
                            historical demand patterns.</li>
                        <li> Demand Forecasting: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for effective inventory
                            management. Use statistical methods or forecasting algorithms to predict future
                            demand based on historical data, market trends, seasonality, or other relevant factors.
                            Regularly review and update your forecasts to account for demand variability.
                            </li>
                        <li> Reorder Point (ROP): The reorder point is the inventory level at which a new order
                            should be placed to replenish stock. It is typically determined based on the lead time,
                            average demand, and safety stock. With demand variability, consider adjusting the
                            reorder point to accommodate higher or lower demand scenarios.
                            </li>
                        <li>  Dynamic Replenishment: Implement dynamic replenishment policies that adjust order
                            quantities and frequencies based on current demand conditions. For example, you
                            can use Just-in-Time (JIT) or Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) systems to receive
                            inventory as needed or collaborate closely with suppliers to respond quickly to
                            changing demand.
                            </li>
                        <li> Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR): Collaborate with
                            suppliers, distributors, or customers to share information and align inventory
                            management strategies. By sharing demand forecasts, production plans, and
                            inventory data, all stakeholders can better anticipate and respond to demand
                            variability.</li>
                        <li> Safety Lead Time: In addition to safety stock, you can introduce safety lead time to
                            account for potential delays in replenishment due to supply chain disruptions or
                            unexpected events. By extending lead times, you create a cushion to accommodate
                            demand fluctuations during replenishment.</li>
                        <li>Continuous Monitoring and Adjustments: Regularly monitor inventory levels, demand
                            patterns, and lead times. Analyse data, identify trends and make timely adjustments to
                            inventory management strategies. Embrace a data-driven approach to identify and
                            address demand variability effectively.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Remember, the optimal approach to handling demand variability may vary depending on
                        your specific industry, product characteristics, supply chain setup, and business goals.
                        Consider utilising a combination of strategies and continuously evaluate and refine your
                        inventory management practices based on real-time information and feedback.</p>

                    <p><b>Predicting Demand with AI</b></p>
                    
                    <p>The goal of Inventory Management is to stock up and manage inventory efficiently so that
                        we can accommodate future demands. Let’s take up two different scenarios:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>We are currently in a high-demand period and will be moving into a low-demand
                            period, so we want to have a reduced inventory size as demand drops.
                            </li>
                        <li>We are currently in a low-demand period and have to stock up inventory for an
                            upcoming high-demand period so that we don’t run out of stock when demands
                            increase.
                            </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The problem is, how do we know the amount of inventory we need to have at different times
                        of the year? This becomes especially important in the case of seasonal goods like
                        air-conditioners, heaters, etc.</p>
                    <p>With the availability of historical data about the demand for goods across the year, we can
                        train predictive Machine Learning algorithms that can forecast the inventory we need to
                        have to match upcoming demands.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>ML Algorithms for Demand Forecasting</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Given past data on demand, we can train a number of different Machine Learning models to
                        make future predictions on demands, and we can use the outcomes to plan inventory size
                        for upcoming periods. Let’s have a look at some of these models:
                        </p>
                    

                    <p><b>ARIMA/SARIMA and other time series forecasting models</b></p>
                    <p>There are several popular time series forecasting algorithms used for demand forecasting in
                        inventory management. Some of these algorithms include ARIMA (Autoregressive
                        Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (ES),
                        Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL), Prophet, Holt-Winters Method, Vector
                        Autoregression (VAR), Neural Networks (such as LSTM and RNN), and Gradient Boosting
                        algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM</p>

                    <p><b>ARIMA</b> (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models are widely used for demand
                        forecasting in inventory management. ARIMA models capture the linear dependencies in
                        time series data by considering the autoregressive (AR) component, the moving average
                        (MA) component, and the differencing (I) component. The AR component captures the
                        relationship between current and past observations, the MA component models the
                        dependency on past error terms, and the I component accounts for trends and seasonality
                        through differencing. ARIMA models can be useful for forecasting demand patterns,
                        identifying trends, and estimating the impact of past observations on future demand.</p>
                        <p><b>SARIMA</b> (Seasonal ARIMA) models extend the capabilities of ARIMA models by
                            incorporating seasonality into the forecasting process. SARIMA models consider the
                            seasonal component in addition to the AR, MA, and differencing components. They are
                            effective for demand forecasting when data exhibits periodic patterns and fluctuations over
                            specific seasons or time intervals. By capturing and modelling seasonality, SARIMA models
                            provide more accurate predictions for inventory management, enabling businesses to
                            account for recurring patterns and adjust their inventory levels accordingly to meet customer
                            demands.
                            </p>
                    <p>SARIMA is one of the most widely used time series forecasting algorithms for demand
                        forecasting in inventory management.
                        </p>
                    <p>SARIMA is particularly suited for data with seasonal patterns and fluctuations. It extends the
                        capabilities of ARIMA models by incorporating the seasonal component into the forecasting
                        process. By considering both the non-seasonal and seasonal components of a time series,
                        SARIMA models can capture complex patterns and provide accurate forecasts.

                    <p><b>Automating Reorder Points</b></p>
                    <p>In inventory management, a reorder point is a predetermined inventory level at which an
                        order should be placed to replenish stock before it runs out. It helps ensure that sufficient
                        inventory is available to meet customer demand while avoiding stockouts and associated
                        costs.
                        </p>
                    <p>In practical terms, think of Starbucks maintaining a reorder point for their coffee beans at,
                        say, 100 kilograms. When their inventory dwindles to this level, it triggers an automatic
                        reorder from suppliers. This safeguards against running out of coffee beans, ensuring they
                        meet customer demand without interruptions. This strategy optimises their inventory,
                        preventing overstock while averting stockouts, ultimately maintaining seamless coffee
                        production at Starbucks stores.</p>

                    <p>Let’s try to figure out what factors are important while determining the reorder point for a
                        particular product:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Lead Time (time taken for an order to be delivered after being placed) would be an
                            important factor as it ensures that inventory doesn’t fall below a critical level.</li>
                        <li>Average Daily Demand is an obvious factor as it determines the rate at which
                            inventory is declining.
                            </li>
                        <li>Safety Stock, which is the extra inventory maintained to account for demand
                            variability or unexpected delays in delivery.
                            </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Considering these factors, we now come to the formula for reorder point calculation, which
                        is as follows:
                        </p>
                    <p><b>Reorder Point = (Average Daily Demand x Lead Time) + Safety Stock</b></p>
                    <p>Using this formula and available data, we can easily determine the reorder point for any
                        particular stock in our inventory.</p>

                    <p><b>Manual Reorder point calculation</b></p>
                    <p>In manual reorder point planning, you define both the reorder level and the safety stock level
                        manually in the master data record of the respective material. This method has several drawbacks, including Time Inefficiency, Human errors, and Limited Scalability. We
                        shall now look at a more optimised way of determining Reorder Points with the help of
                        Artificial Intelligence</p>
                    <p><b>Automatic Reorder point calculation</b></p>
                    <p>AI-powered reorder point automation provides a streamlined and effective approach to

                        point automation:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Collect historical data on product demand, lead times, and other pertinent parameters.</li>
                        <li>Using the obtained data, train an AI model, such as a machine learning algorithm. The
                            model should be built to forecast future demand patterns, estimate lead times, and
                            optimise reorder points based on service levels sought and cost considerations.</li>
                        <li> Use the AI model that has been developed to forecast future demand and estimate
                            lead times.
                            </li>
                        <li>Calculate appropriate reorder points for each product by including expected demand
                            and estimated lead times in the AI model.
                            </li>

                        Inventory management plays a pivotal role in Walmart's global success story, allowing the
                        retail giant to outshine competitors like Target and Amazon. Walmart's innovative inventory management strategies have revolutionised its supply chain operations,
                        contributing significantly to its competitive advantage.</p>

                    <p>The Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) model is one of Walmart's key inventory management
                        approaches. VMI shifts much of the inventory management burden to suppliers, fostering a
                        collaborative relationship. In this system, suppliers actively manage inventory for Walmart,
                        relying on real-time data to synchronise demand and replenishment planning. This approach
                        has yielded several advantages for both Walmart and its suppliers:

                    <p>Managing the ordering, receiving, reviewing, and approval of things from suppliers is part of
                        the procurement management process(a way to buy things from outside vendors). Supplier
                        management is concentrated on how the suppliers affect the life of the business, while vendor management is focused on pricing comparisons and contract negotiations.
                        </p>
                    <p>The form of vendor management used in the majority of company settings today is adequate
                        for successfully managing a small number of vendors. However, as the demands change,
                        more sophisticated administration is needed for a whole vendor ecosystem in larger
                        businesses. The sheer volume of contacts, contracts, products, tasks, and other items in
                        this environment far exceeds customary procedures. Fortunately, AI excels at handling data,
                        and new tools are being developed to modernise vendor relationship management.
                        </p>
                    <p>Briefly put, procurement is a difficult process that requires handling enormous amounts of

                    <p>A more effective method of supplier finding is now taking shape. A new generation of

                        expertise with an AI algorithm, dramatically improving the supplier identification process. A
                        category expert clearly and concisely characterises the intended good, service, or
                        manufacturing capacity, together with any limitations like geography. Millions of suppliers
                        have access to often updated source data from a range of proprietary, open-source, and
                        commercial databases, some of which are regionally and globally focused. A natural
                        language processing (NLP) algorithm is then iteratively trained by the category specialist to
                        search through the supplier descriptions in the combined data set. The NLP algorithm
                        quickly reduces the list of potential suppliers to a select handful that meets the sourcing
                        expert's requirements. A selection of potential providers may be found from a database of
                        millions of suppliers in just a few hours thanks to this iterative technique, which enables
                        search engines to work with previously unheard-of speed and accuracy(Exhibit).</p>

                    <p>Let's break down the two NLP methods mentioned in the text:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>FastText: FastText is a technique used for word representation and text classification.
                            It creates word vectorisations, which means it converts words into numerical
                            representations that can be understood by a computer. These representations capture
                            the meaning and context of words. In the context of supplier discovery, FastText was
                            likely used to convert the textual purchase order descriptions into numerical
                            representations that could be processed and analysed by machine learning
                            algorithms.
                            </li>
                            <li>HDBScan: HDBScan stands for Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
                                Applications with Noise. It is a clustering algorithm used to group similar data points
                                together. In the case of supplier discovery, HDBScan was applied to the word
                                vectorisations created by FastText. The goal was to identify clusters of similar
                                purchase order descriptions, indicating potential similarities between the suppliers
                                associated with those orders. By clustering the word vectors, HDBScan helps identify
                                patterns and groupings that can assist in the discovery of new suppliers.
                                </li>

                    <p><b>AI in Supplier Performance Management</b></p>
                    <p>An essential component of supply chain management and procurement is supplier
                        performance management. In order to make sure suppliers fulfil quality, delivery, pricing, and
                        other contractual obligations entails tracking and evaluating their performance. AI's potential
                        to increase productivity and decision-making in supplier performance management is
                        enormous.
                        </p>
                    <p>Predictive analytics enabled by AI can forecast supplier performance, enabling businesses
                        to foresee and reduce potential risks and interruptions. AI algorithms can provide insights
                        into supplier behaviour, such as delivery delays or quality issues, by analysing past data and
                        external circumstances, allowing preemptive steps to be performed. By connecting with
                        numerous data sources, such as IoT devices, supply chain management systems, and
                        external data streams, AI can also make it easier to monitor supplier performance in real
                        time. Automated alarms can be sent off if performance thresholds are exceeded, allowing
                        for prompt problem-solving and proactive problem management.
                        AI can be used to compare a supplier's performance to industry norms or those of other
                        vendors. The areas where suppliers need to improve can be determined using this data. AI
                        can be used to track a supplier's adherence to agreements, rules, and other specifications.
                        Problems can be avoided by using this information, and suppliers' duties can be confirmed.
                        </p>
					<p><b>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</b>, a widely used NLP algorithm, recognises and classifies
                        particular entities inside the text, such as supplier names, product names, and contract
                        terms. In order to analyse and evaluate contractual commitments, this assists in automating
                        the extraction of crucial information from supplier contracts. Another significant NLP
                        algorithm that may evaluate the sentiment represented in customer reviews or emails is
                        sentiment analysis. AI systems can identify if a text's sentiment is favourable, negative, or
                        neutral by examining its tone and substance. This examination offers information on general
                        performance, prospective supplier problems, and customer satisfaction. A huge corpus of
                        unstructured text data can also be used to find important topics or themes using Topic
                        Modelling methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This assists in identifying recurrent
                        problems, new patterns, or shared difficulties in supplier contracts, correspondence, or
                        customer comments.
                        </p>
                    <p>A substantial amount of potential exists for improving transparency, traceability, and
                        automation in supplier performance monitoring when AI, blockchain technology, and smart
                        contracts are combined. A decentralised and unchangeable record of transactions and
                        interactions is provided by blockchain. On the other hand, smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predetermined terms and conditions. By combining AI and
                        blockchain technology, an audit trail of supplier performance data that is both transparent
                        and impenetrable can be created. This guarantees that the performance measurements,
                        assessments, and any related actions are documented in a secure and impermeable way.
                        AI-driven performance assessments can be recorded as blockchain transactions, giving a
                        reliable and auditable history of supplier performance. Based on AI-driven performance
                        evaluations, smart contracts can automate the performance of prescribed activities. A smart
                        contract, for instance, may be programmed to automatically enact penalty provisions or alert
                        concerned parties if an AI system identifies a supplier as not meeting predetermined quality
                        criteria. Since all parties can rely on the transparent and automatic execution of contractual
                        duties, this lowers the need for manual involvement and the likelihood of disputes. The
                        algorithms employed in blockchain-based and smart contract-driven AI-driven supplier
                        performance management are determined by the particular needs of the organisation. To
                        analyse performance data and produce insights. These algorithms can categorise providers
                        according to their performance, forecast performance trends in the future, and suggest the
                        best course of action.</p>
                    <p>One area where machine learning excels is in analysing historical data related to
                        procurement incidents, such as fraud and theft events involving external suppliers. By
                        training machine learning models on this data, organisations can develop a procurement risk
                        score that helps identify potential high-risk supplier partners. These models analyse
                        attributes of past incidents to uncover patterns and similarities, enabling procurement
                        professionals to take proactive action before a procurement incident occurs.
                        </p>
                    <p>Risk modelling techniques, such as decision trees and random forests, are commonly
                        employed in developing procurement risk scores. Decision trees break down the
                        decision-making process into a series of sequential questions, leading to the identification of
                        high-risk suppliers based on their attributes and historical incident data. Random forests, on
                        the other hand, combine multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate risk
                        assessment model. By leveraging these techniques, organisations can make data-driven
                        decisions, strengthen their supplier screening processes, and safeguard against potential
                        risks.</p>
                    <p>In addition to risk management, machine learning can significantly enhance communication
                        between procurement professionals and suppliers. By analysing communication patterns
                        within various organisations, machine learning models can predict which suppliers are more
                        likely to respond quickly to requests or questions. This capability allows procurement professionals to communicate more effectively with suppliers, ensuring prompt and efficient
                        resolution of supplier-related issues.</p>
                    <p>AI algorithms can enable businesses to implement dynamic pricing strategies based on
                        real-time market conditions and customer behaviour. By continuously analysing market
                        signals and customer preferences, AI systems can adjust pricing in response to changes in
                        demand, inventory levels, or competitor pricing. This dynamic pricing approach helps
                        businesses optimise revenue and maximise profitability</p>

                    <p><b>Warehouse optimisation using AI</b></p>
                    <p>A series of actions that ensure that items enter and exit the warehouse smoothly are known
                        as warehouse operations. Well-organized warehouse operations have turned into a crucial
                        source of competitive advantage for supply chain organisations since the introduction of
                        e-commerce and the expanding significance of warehouses in the client purchasing
                        process.
                        </p>
                    <p>The key work activities in warehouse operations can be grouped into six main categories:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Receiving -</b> When incoming goods are received, checked, and labelled.</li>
                        <li><b>Put-away - </b>Placing the received goods in the storage area</li>
                        <li><b>. Storage - </b>Tasks related to organising and operating the warehouse storage area to be
                            space-efficient and process-efficient.</li>
                        <li><b>Picking -</b> Automated or manual picking or orders, B2B or directly to the consumer.</li>
                        <li><b>Packing -</b> Picked items are packed in boxes safely and with as little air as possible</li>
                        <li><b>. Shipping - </b>The packed boxes are transferred to the transport company and checked
                            out.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Algorithms are used in machine learning to "learn from experience" and arrive at useful
                        warehousing decisions. It recognises trends in sensor data and suggests quicker
                        replenishing of virtually depleted inventory, shorter walking distances, and better inventory
                        arrangement. Wearable technology for warehouses is made possible by some AI features.
                        Voice-picking is made possible by natural language processing, which makes work safer
                        and more hands-free for employees. With the aid of computer vision, barcodes may be
                        automatically recognised by smart glasses' cameras. Computer vision is also used via
                        cameras that are strategically positioned throughout the warehouse to enable end-to-end product tracking. Finally, robotics enables AI to roam around in the actual world and give it a
                        tangible presence. The abilities of AI robots can include everything from choosing tasks to
                        transporting merchandise throughout a warehouse and loading or unloading a pallet.
                        </p>
                    <p>Some other ways in which AI is reshaping warehouse management are mentioned below:</p>

                    <ol><li><b>. Productivity: </b>Increase the effectiveness of pick-and-pack operations. Because ML
                        enables managers to capitalise on the effectiveness of the most productive pickers to
                        produce a completely integrated system-directed solution, processes are transformed
                        and simplified. The interface for operating rules to be used in the smart warehouse
                        and a suggested SKU strategy based on past and future sales data are already
                        included in slotting software. While humans still modify slotting tactics based on their
                        own expertise and experience, this practice will eventually give way to ML algorithms.</li>
                        <li><b> Communication: </b>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms allow
                            automated systems to interact at a rate that is several times faster than that of human
                            operators. Many warehouse-related tasks are already automated, but by combining
                            IoT-enabled devices into these operations, speed and accuracy will be greatly
                            increased. All components of your system can engage in a discussion that includes
                            system monitoring and control thanks to wireless cloud data transfers. Deep learning
                            techniques also give computers the ability to continually analyse the data streams
                            produced by these components, enabling them to make improvements and
                            modifications in an integrated WMS (Warehouse Management System) in real time.</li>
                        <li><b>Wages:</b> Payroll costs will be cut, initially being compensated by the necessary
                            technical expenditure. The labour costs aspect of how AI will change warehouse
                            management is the most disputed. At this point in its development, robot aid barely
                            affects how things are done now. Though 30% of UK warehousing jobs will be totally
                            automated by 2030, AI has the ability — and will have the potential — to increase
                            machine handling capabilities. The most likely industries for automation are those that
                            involve data gathering, processing, and predictable physical operations. Established
                            eCommerce businesses assert that rising automation will increase the overall scope of
                            their business operations and hence generate jobs, but this will only become clear
                            over time.
                            </li>
                        <li><b>Warehouse logistics:</b>Processing times and operator error reduction can boost
                            productivity and overall effectiveness. Using AI to optimise logistics will change
                            warehouse management as well. Think about figuring out how many pallets need
                            to be moved each day, how much equipment is needed to handle that movement,
                            and how much labour is necessary to complete that movement. In the past, these
                            estimates were based on the operator's expertise and SKUs (stock-keeping units).
                            ML algorithms now make it possible to forecast and manage stock movement in
                            great detail to improve material handling.</li>
                        <li><b>Inventory:</b> Free up resources that were previously devoted to inventory management
                            for other business expansion areas. By tracking products with digital tags and
                            enabling more precise and accurate inventory control, radio frequency identification
                            (RFID) replaces paper trails and barcode scanners for inventory organisation and
                            control. RFID scanners do not require direct line-of-sight control because the system
                            employs radio waves to convey data; instead, they are aimed in the general direction
                            of a product to identify it and direct its movement into, out of, and around the
                            warehouse</li>

                    <p><b>Quality Control using AI</b></p>
                    <p>Products are more likely to break or wear out before their guarantee period ends when
                        supply chain quality management is subpar. Depending on the type of business, there are a
                        lot of failures that might happen after a product leaves a manufacturing plant. Customers
                        who are required to return goods eventually stop favouring the store where they made their
                        purchase. In the end, supply chain quality management aids in preserving a company's
                        reputation. The degree of external supplier input control will determine how often returns
                        and potentially dangerous product defects are to occur.</p>
                    <p>Keeping a competitive edge in the market and lowering operating expenses require quality
                        management in the supply chain for these reasons. Waste becomes more common than is
                        acceptable in the absence of quality management. Your business may prevent and address
                        supply chain concerns by reviewing the elements of quality management systems.</p>
                    <p>AI has a lot to offer in terms of logistics support for quality control. It can inspect products as
                        they enter and exit your fulfilment processes and look for flaws, negligent packing
                        techniques that might put products in danger, invalid labelling, and other things. It can also
                        keep an eye on the software that helps you manage your business and guide you in making
                        the best decisions by analysing data. AI may assist in making sure your order products are
                        up to par, whether it be through incoming procedures, daily inspections, picking and packing
                        activities, pre-shipping jobs, or other intermediary steps.

                    <p>Among the most significant ways AI might enhance quality control logistics are:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Keeping track of inventory levels and expiration dates to determine when to remove
                            and replace products.</li>
                            <li>By recording the condition of inventory goods in your warehouse or inventory
                                management system, you may reduce wasted inventory and lost income.
                                </li>
                        <li> Highlighting inconsistencies in item weights or dimensions so your warehouse staff
                            can address any issues and stop defective items from progressing further along your
                            supply chain or fulfilment process.
                            </li>    
                        <li>Identifying flaws in your warehouse hardware, integration links, or warehouse
                            management systems (WMS) to prevent problems from turning into downtime and
                            quality control difficulties.
                            </li>
                        <li>Notifying staff members of missed quality management system steps by highlighting
                            them in SOPs, product checklists, or other procedural documents.</li>
                        <li>Identifying flaws using data from your enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions
                            and client feedback.</li>
                        <li> Enables objective, data-driven decision-making, relieving your staff of the need to
                            anticipate or hazard a guess as to what should be done when a problem arises with
                            one of your products.
                            </li>
                        <li>To reduce the possibility of items being damaged throughout the fulfilment process,
                                optimise the picking and packaging waves, walking routes, and station traffic.
                                </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>Use Case of AI in Quality Control:</b></p>
                    <p>Anatoli Gorchet, co-founder and CTO of Neurala, a provider of AI vision software, outlines
                        the method behind conventional industrial inspection processes utilising machine vision to
                        help demonstrate how AI is transforming machine vision. In the first phase, a professional
                        selects the camera-captured elements (such as edges, curves, corners, colour patches,
                        etc.) that are pertinent to the inspection. The expert then develops a rule-based system that
                        specifies, for instance, how much "yellow" and "curvature" designate an object as a "ripe
                        banana" in a packaging line. Based on the expert's input, the resulting system automatically
                        determines whether the product is what was anticipated. Even though it has proven quite
                        successful, there are specific situations when it renders machine vision useless. Gorchet
                        noted that it might be challenging to distinguish between good and terrible items in situations
                        where the differences are highly qualitative, nuanced, or variable.</p>
                    <p>AI has a role in this situation. The AI-powered software may learn which elements are
                        significant on its own and establish rules that identify the combinations of attributes that
                        constitute excellent products rather than having the machine vision system rely on the rules
                        created by the expert. Users no longer have to manually create a machine vision model for
                        each production situation thanks to neural network learning algorithms, according to
                        Gorchet. "They just need to gather the right data and train the model with it, whether it's for
                        fruits, aeroplane parts or ventilator valves."
                        </p>
                    <p>The standard deep learning system, Gorchet explained, "once these pictures are collected,
                        has a training regimen that, when fed a good quantity and variety of data, trains a model that
                        ends up being really good at coming up with precise, low error, confident classifications." Of
                        course, fresh data collecting, training, and deployment procedures will need to be carried
                        out to create a new model if the line changes to a different part or product.</p>
                    <p>A novel type of DNN is being investigated for industrial quality inspections to simplify this
                        procedure. These DNNs are referred to as "lifelong" or "continual" learning DNNs (L-DNNs).
                        Gorchet claims that these L-DNNs separate feature training from rule training in order to add
                        new rule knowledge instantly. "Like conventional DNNs, they need a slow learning of
                        features based on a large balanced set of data—which includes equal amounts of images of
                        good valves as well as every possible type of defective valve; but unlike conventional DNNs,
                        they do not include rule learning at this stage and therefore do not require images of all
                        known valve defects," he said.
                        </p>
                    <p>Actually, the photos don't even have to be of valves as long as they share characteristics
                        like curves, edges, and surface characteristics. This data set does not have to be
                        industry-specific and can be rather general. As a result, the L-DNN provider only needs to
                        create the model once, and the manufacturers are unaffected in any way.</p>
                    <p>This indicates that for the system to acquire a set of rules for what a good valve is,
                        manufacturers only need a limited amount of photos of good valves. According to Gorchet,
                        L-DNNs have the ability to learn from a single presentation of a small dataset using just
                        high-quality data and then provide advice to the user when they come across an unusual
                        product. "An L-DNN training regimen can go over a set of tens of images, build a
                        prototypical understanding of the object, and be ready to be deployed and reconfigured if
                        and when production changes," the expert claimed.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Future Prospects</b></p>
                    <p>Looking further into the future, the integration of natural language processing (NLP) and
                        computer vision (CV) technologies holds great potential for advanced inventory
                        management:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Voice-Enabled Inventory Control: NLP can enable voice commands and
                            conversational interfaces for inventory management systems. Users can interact with
                            the system using natural language, making inquiries about stock levels, placing
                            orders, or querying inventory-related information. This streamlines the inventory
                            management process and allows for hands-free, intuitive control.</li>
                            <li> Sentiment Analysis and Customer Feedback: NLP can analyse customer feedback,
                                reviews, and social media posts to extract insights regarding product preferences,
                                satisfaction levels, and emerging trends. Integrating sentiment analysis into inventory management systems enables businesses to adjust their inventory strategies based
                                on customer sentiment, leading to more targeted and customer-centric inventory
                                decisions.
                                </li>
                            <li>Intelligent Product Categorization: NLP techniques can automatically categorise
                                products based on textual descriptions, reducing manual effort and ensuring
                                consistent classification across different inventory systems. This enables better
                                organisation and easier searchability of inventory items.</li>
                            <li>Visual Recognition for Inventory Tracking: CV technology can be employed to track
                                and identify inventory items through visual recognition. This includes barcode
                                scanning, object detection, and image recognition to accurately monitor stock levels,
                                locate specific items, and automate inventory counting processes.</li>
                            <li>Image-Based Demand Forecasting: CV techniques combined with demand
                                forecasting models can leverage images and visual data to predict demand patterns.
                                For example, by analysing images of fashion trends or product usage, AI models can
                                forecast demand for specific products or styles, assisting businesses in proactive
                                inventory planning and stock optimisation.</li>
                            <li>Shelf Monitoring and Optimization: CV-based systems can monitor shelves in real
                                time, ensuring proper stocking, identifying misplaced items, and providing alerts for
                                restocking. This technology helps optimise shelf layouts</li>    
                            <p>Nordstrom, a luxury department store chain renowned for its high-end fashion and
                                exceptional customer service, recently launched a new inventory strategy — that there is no
                                inventory. They've developed a new store concept called Nordstrom Local, which is a small
                                area where they focus on the consumers rather than the product. Customers want quick and
                                easy shopping experiences, and Nordstrom capitalised on this. Alteration services, personal
                                styling, nail salons, beverages, online order pick-ups, and no inventory are available at the
                                store. By establishing this store concept, they are demonstrating their dedication to their
                                clients and providing them with what they truly desire.
                                </p>
                            <p>The future of inventory is going to be flooded with updates in technology. From virtual reality
                                to artificial intelligence, to digital signage, and even inventory-less stores, there are constant
                                iterations made in this industry to accelerate business and attract customers. And it’s only
                                growing from here.</p>
