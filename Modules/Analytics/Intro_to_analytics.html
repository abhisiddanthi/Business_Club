                                    <h2>WHAT DO DATA ANALYSTS DO?</h2>
                    <p>Data analysts translate numbers into plain english. Every business collects data, whether it's sales 
                    figures, market research, logistics, or transportation costs. A data analyst's job is to take that data and 
                    use it to help companies make better business decisions. This could mean figuring out how to price 
                    new materials for the market, how to reduce transportation costs, solve issues that cost the company 
                    money, or determine how many people should be working on Saturdays.</p>

                    <p>There are many different types of data analysts in the field, including operations analysts, marketing 
                    analysts, financial analysts, etc.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Interpret data, analyze results using statistical techniques and provide ongoing reports.</li>
                        <li>Identify, analyze, and interpret trends or patterns in complex data sets.</li>
                        <li>Filter and “clean” data, and review computer reports, printouts, and performance indicators to locate and correct code problems.</li>
                        <li>Work closely with management to prioritize business and information needs.</li>
                        <li>Locate and define new process improvement opportunities.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <h2>Analytics</h2>
                <p>People often tend to confuse between some of the terms, frequently used interchangeably:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Refers to the umbrella of techniques where you are trying to extract information and insights from data. This includes MIS reporting on the lowest level to building predictive models on the higher level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Mining:</strong> Refers to the science of collecting all the past data and then searching for patterns in this data. You look for consistent patterns and/or relationships between variables. Once you find these insights, you validate the findings by applying the detected patterns to new subsets of data. The ultimate goal of data mining is prediction - and predictive data mining is the most common type of data mining and one that has the most direct business applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> This is a loosely used term. People running reporting also say that they are analysing data and so do predictive modelers. Any attempt to make sense of data can be called as data analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine learning</strong> - is the science of creating algorithms and program which learn on their own. Once designed, they do not need a human to become better. Some of the common applications of machine learning include following: Web Search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, computer vision and drug design. An easy way to understand is this - it is humanly impossible to create models for every possible search or spam, so you make the machine intelligent enough to learn by itself. When you automate the later part of data mining - it is known as machine learning.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-08 at 23.32.53.png" width="100%"/></p>


                <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>

                <p>One of the standard definitions of machine learning, as given by Tom Mitchell – a Professor at the 
                Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), is a computer program is said to learn from experience E with 
                respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as 
                measured by P, improves with experience E or simply put, the program learns through its experience 
                to build better performing models.</p>

                <p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using 
                    algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights 
                    without being explicitly programmed where to look.</p>
                
                    <p>Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors like growing volumes and varieties of 
                    available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data 
                    storage have made more popular than ever.</p>
                
                    <p>All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze 
                    bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And 
                    by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities 
                    – or avoiding unknown risks.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
                    <p>Although people tend to come up with a different categorization of ML algorithms according to the 
                    need at a broad level, one can categorize algorithms based on the way data is provided to learn from. 
                    The following are the main categorization of learning algorithms:</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: In this setting, we provide a model a training data set, which 
                        consists of the data and the true labels. Given this data, a model is learned. Obviously 
                        here, the more the data, the better the model will perform on unknown examples. Key 
                        factors here are that the model should generalize to unseen examples. Classification, 
                        Regression, Ranking fall under this learning paradigm.</li>
                
                        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: In this setting, the model automatically organizes data 
                        without any labeled examples. Examples of this include Clustering of Data, 
                        Summarization etc. Data is organized based on the similarity of the data items.</li>
                
                        <li><strong>Semi Supervised Learning</strong>: This is a hybrid between unsupervised and supervised, 
                        where some of the data is labeled, while a large pool of the data is actually unlabeled. 
                        Algorithms here take the entire labeled data, and intelligently use the unlabeled data 
                        to improve the model performance.</li>
                
                        <li><strong>Online Learning/ Active Learning</strong>: In this paradigm, the algorithms keep improving 
                        itself by using feedback of a human in the loop.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 01.32.06.png" width="100%"/></p>

                    <p>Within each of these paradigms of learning, there are several different modeling techniques. Of course, 
                        before even getting to the modeling aspect (i.e. which machine learning model to use, one must 
                        choose the right set of features. This is called ​Feature engineering ​​,​​ and this often plays a significant 
                        role in getting good results. This also often requires domain expertise.</p>
                    
                        <h2>Introduction to Excel as an analytics tool</h2>
                        <p>Even before learning R or Python, it is advisable to have knowledge of Excel. It does no harm to add                    
                        excel in your skill sets. Excel, with its wide range of functions, visualization, arrays empowers you to                 
                        quickly generate insights from data which would be hard to see otherwise.</p>
                    
                        <p>It has a few drawbacks as well. It can’t handle large data sets very efficiently. Excel has numerous                  
                        functions. It becomes confusing at times to choose the best one. Here, some tips and tricks to work on                   
                        Excel and save your time are given. This article is best suited to people keen to upgrade their data                   
                        analysis skills.</p>

                        <h3>XLStat an Introduction</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjyNNiDKrKs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjyNNiDKrKs</a></p>
                    
                        <h2>Commonly used functions</h2>


                        <p>1. ​Vlookup(): It helps to search a value in a table and returns a corresponding value. Let’s look at the                    
                            table below (Policy and Customer). In Policy table, we want to map city name from the customer tables                  
                            based on common key “Customer id”. Here, function vlookup() would help to perform this task.</p>
                        
                            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 01.36.16.png" width="100%"/></p>

                            <p>Syntax: =VLOOKUP(Key to lookup, Source_table, column of source table, are you ok with relative 
                            match?)</p>
                        
                            <p>For above problem, we can write formula in cell “F4” as =VLOOKUP(B4, $H$4:$L$15, 5, 0) and this will                  
                            return the city name for all the Customer id 1 and post that copy this formula for all Customer ids.</p>
                        
                            <p>Tip: Do not forget to lock the range of the second table using “$” sign – a common error when copying                     
                            this formula down. This is known as relative referencing. Alternatively, you can use F4 to lock cell                 
                            reference.</p>
                        

                            <p>2. ​CONCATENATE()​​:  It is very useful to combine text from two or more cells into one cell. For example: 
                                we want to create a URL based on input of host name and request path</p>

                                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="..//Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 01.37.48.png" width="100%"/></p>

                            
                                <p>Syntax: =Concatenate(Text1, Text2,.....Textn)</p>
                            
                                <p>Above problem can be solved using formula, =concatenate(B3,C3) and copy it.</p>
                            
                                <p>Tip: I prefer using “&” symbol, because it is shorter than typing a full “concatenate” formula, and does                  
                                the exactly same thing. The formula can be written as  “= B3&C3”.</p>
                            
                                <p>3. ​LEN() – This function tells you about the length of a cell i.e. number of characters including spaces                   
                                and special characters .</p>

                                <p>Example: =Len(B3) = 23</p>
                            
                                <p>4. ​LOWER(), UPPER() and PROPER() –These three functions help to change the text to lower, upper and                 
                                sentence case respectively (First letter of each word capital).</p>
                            
                                <p>Syntax: =Upper(Text)/ Lower(Text) / Proper(Text)</p>

                                <p>5. ​TRIM()​​: This is a handy function used to clean text that has leading and trailing white space. Often 
                                when you get a dump of data from a database the text you’re dealing with is padded with blanks. And 
                                if you don’t deal with them, they are also treated as unique entries in a list, which is certainly not 
                                helpful.</p>

                                <p>6. ​If()​​:It is one of the most useful function in excel. It lets you use conditional formulas which calculate 
                                one way when a certain thing is true, and another way when false. For example, you want to mark each 
                                sales as “High” and “Low”. If sales is greater than or equals to $5000 then “High” else “Low”.</p>

                                <h2>Generating inference from Data</h2>

                                <p>1. ​Pivot Table ​​: Whenever you are working with company data, you seek answers for questions like 
                                “How much revenue is contributed by branches of North region?” or “What was the average number 
                                of customers for product A?” and many others.</p>
                            
                                <p>Excel’s Pivot Table helps you to answer these questions effortlessly. Pivot table is a summary table that 
                                lets you count, average, sum, and perform other calculations according to the reference feature you 
                                have selected i.e.  It converts a data table to inference table which helps us to take decisions. Look at below snapshots:</p>

                                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 01.40.53.png" width="100%"/></p>

                                <p>Above, you can see that table on the left has sales detail against each customer with region and
                                    product mapping. In table to the right, the information is summarised at region level which now helps
                                    us to generate an inference that South region has highest sales.</p>

                                <h3>Methods to create Pivot table:</h3>
                                
                                <p>Step-1: ​​Click somewhere in the list of data. Choose the ​Insert​ tab, and click ​PivotTable​. Excel will 
                                automatically select the area containing data, including the headings. If it does not select the area 
                                correctly, drag over the area to select it manually. Placing the PivotTable on a new sheet is best, so click 
                                New Worksheet​ for the location and then click ​OK</p>

                                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 01.43.14.png" width="100%"/></p>
                            
                                <p>Step-2​​: Now, you can see the PivotTable Field List panel, which contains the fields from your list; all you 
                                need to do is to arrange them in the boxes at the foot of the panel. Once you have done that, the 
                                diagram on the left becomes your PivotTable.</p>
                            
                                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 01.43.34.png" width="100%"/></p>

                                <p>Above, you can see that we have arranged “Region” in row, “Product id” in column and sum of
                                    “Premium” is taken as value. Now you are ready with pivot table which shows Region and Product wise
                                    sum of premium. You can also use count, average, min, max and other summary metric.</p>

                                <p>2. Creating Charts: ​​Building a chart/ graph in excel requires nothing more than selecting the range of                 
                                data you wish to chart and press F11. This will create a excel chart in default chart style but you can                     
                                change it by selecting different chart style. If you prefer the chart to be on the same worksheet as the                    
                                data, instead of pressing F11, press ALT + F1. Of course, in either case, once you have created the chart, you can customize to your particular needs
                                to communicate your desired message.</p>

                                <p>Apart from Excel we have other analytics tools like SAS, R or Python. Using which tool completely 
                                    depends on the user.</p>
                                
                                    <h2>R vs Python</h2>
                                    <p>For most data analysis projects, the goal is to create the highest quality analysis in the least amount of 
                                    time.</p>
                                
                                    <p>If one can understand the underlying concepts behind what they are doing, then they can use either 
                                    language to perform your analysis.</p>
                                
                                    <p>R has a much bigger library of statistical packages</p>
                                    <p>If you’re doing specialized statistical work, R packages cover more techniques. You can find R packages 
                                    for a wide variety of statistical tasks using the CRAN task view. R packages cover everything from 
                                    Psychometrics to Genetics to Finance. Although Python, through SciPy and packages like stats-models, 
                                    covers the most common techniques, R is far ahead.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Python is better for building analytics tools</p>
                                    <p>R and Python are equally good if you want to find outliers in a dataset, but if you want to create a web 
                                    service to enable other people to upload datasets and find outliers, Python is better. Python is a 
                                    general purpose programming language, which means that people have built modules to create 
                                    websites, interact with a variety of databases, and manage users.</p>
                                
                                    <p>In general, if you want to build a tool or service that uses data analysis, Python is a better choice.</p>
                                
                                    <p>R builds in data analysis functionality by default, whereas Python relies on packages</p>
                                    <p>Because Python is a general purpose language, most data analysis functionality is available through 
                                    packages like NumPy and pandas. However, since R was built with statistics and data analysis in mind, 
                                    many tools that have been added to Python through packages are built into base R.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Python is better for deep learning.</p>
                                    <p>Through packages like Lasagne, caffe, keras, and tensorflow, creating deep neural networks is 
                                    straightforward in Python. Although some of these, like tensorflow, are being ported to R, its support is 
                                    still far better in Python.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Python relies on a few main packages, whereas R has hundreds of them.</p>
                                    <p>In Python, sklearn is the “primary” machine learning package, and pandas is the “primary” data analysis 
                                    package. This makes it easy to know how to accomplish a task, but also means that a lot of specialized 
                                    techniques aren’t possible.</p>
                                
                                    <p>R is better for data visualization.</p>
                                    <p>Packages like ggplot2 make plotting easier and more customizable in R than in Python. Python is 
                                    catching up, particularly in the area of interactive plots with packages like Bokeh, but has a way to go.</p>
                                
                                    <p>The bottom line :</p>
                                    <p>Performing data analysis tasks in either language is more similar than you might expect. As long as you 
                                    understand the underlying concepts, pick the language that you’re most familiar with.</p>
                                
                                    <p>R has an edge in statistics and visualization, whereas Python has an advantage in machine learning and 
                                    building tools.</p>
                                
                                    <h2>Introduction to R</h2>
                                    <p>R is a powerful language used widely for data analysis and statistical computing. It was developed in                 
                                    early 90s. Since then, endless efforts have been made to improve R’s user interface. The journey of R                  
                                    language from a rudimentary text editor to interactive R Studio and more recently Jupyter Notebooks               
                                    has engaged many data science communities across the world.</p>

                                    <h3>How to install R Packages?</h3>
                                    <p>The sheer power of R lies in its incredible packages. In R, most data handling tasks can be performed in                    
                                    2 ways: Using R packages and R base functions. To install a package, simply type:</p>
                                
                                    <p><code>install.packages("package name")</code></p>
                                    <p>As a first time user, a pop might appear to select your CRAN mirror (country server), choose                 
                                    accordingly and press OK.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Note: You can type this either in console directly and press ‘Enter’ or in R script and click ‘Run’.</p>

                                    <h2>Python</h2>
                                    <p>For aspiring Data Scientists, Python is probably the most important language to learn because of its rich 
                                    ecosystem.</p>

                                    <p>Python's major advantage is its breadth. For example, R can run Machine Learning algorithms on a
                                        preprocessed dataset, but Python is much better at processing the data. Pandas is an incredibly useful
                                        library that can essentially do everything SQL does and more. matplotlib lets you create useful
                                        visualizations to quickly understand your data.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In terms of algorithm availability, you can get plenty of algorithms out of the box with scikit-learn. And
                                        if you want to customize every detail of your models, Python has Theano. In addition, Theano is easily
                                        configured to run on the GPU, which gives you a cheap and easy way to get much higher speeds
                                        without having to change a single line of code or delve into performance details.</p>
                                
                                    <h3>Introduction to Python</h3>
                                    <p>Step 0: Warming up</p>
                                    <p>Before starting your journey, the first question to answer is:</p>

                                    <p><strong>Why use Python?</strong><br>
                                        or<br>
                                        <strong>How would Python be useful?</strong></p>
                                     <p>Watch the first 30 minutes of this talk from Jeremy, Founder of DataRobot at PyCon 2014, Ukraine to
                                     get an idea of how useful Python could be.</p>

                                        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoxjADZHUQA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoxjADZHUQA</a></p>
                                 
                                     <h2>Step 1: Setting up your machine</h2>
                                     <p>The easiest way to proceed is to just download Anaconda from Continuum.io. It comes packaged with
                                     most of the things you will need ever. The major downside of taking this route is that you will need to
                                     wait for Continuum to update their packages, even when there might be an update available to the
                                     underlying libraries. If you are a starter, that should hardly matter.</p>
                                     <p>If you face any challenges in installing, you can find more <a href="https://www.continuum.io/">detailed instructions for various OS here</a>.</p>
                                 
                                     <h2>Step 2: Learn the basics of Python language</h2>
                                     <p>You should start by understanding the basics of the language, libraries and data structure. The free
                                     interactive Python tutorial by DataCamp is one of the best places to start your journey. This 4-hour
                                     coding course focuses on how to get started with Python for data science, and by the end you should be
                                     comfortable with the basic concepts of the language.</p>

                                        <h2>Step 4: Learn Scientific libraries in Python – NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas</h2>
                                        <p>This is where fun begins! Here is a brief introduction to various libraries. Let’s start practicing some 
                                        common operations.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Practice the <a href="http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial">NumPy tutorial</a> thoroughly, especially NumPy arrays. This will form a good 
                                            foundation for things to come.</li>
                                            <li>Next, look at the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/">SciPy tutorials</a>. Go through the introduction and the basics and do the 
                                            remaining ones basis your needs.</li>
                                            <li>If you guessed Matplotlib tutorials next, you are wrong! They are too comprehensive for our 
                                            need here. Instead look at this <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb">ipython notebook</a> till Line 68 (i.e. till animations)</li>
                                            <li>Finally, let us look at Pandas. Pandas provide DataFrame functionality (like R) for Python. This is 
                                            also where you should spend good time practicing. Pandas would become the most effective 
                                            tool for all mid-size data analysis. Start with a short introduction, <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html">10 minutes to pandas</a>. Then

                                            to know the details of how data is stored.</li>
                                            <li>Architecture Agnostic − Tableau works in all kinds of devices where data flows. Hence, one 
                                            doesn't need not worry about specific hardware or software requirements to use Tableau.</li>
                                            <li>Real-Time Collaboration − Tableau can filter, sort, and discuss data on the fly and embed a live 
                                            dashboard in portals like SharePoint site or Salesforce. One can save your view of data and 
                                            allow colleagues to subscribe to your interactive dashboards so they see the very latest data 
                                            just by refreshing their web browser.</li>
                                            <li>Centralized Data − Tableau server provides a centralized location to manage all of the 
                                            organization’s published data sources. One can delete, change permissions, add tags, and 
                                            manage schedules in one convenient location. It’s easy to schedule extract refreshes and 
                                            manage them in the data server. Administrators can centrally define a schedule for extracts on 
                                            the server for both incremental and full refreshes.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                                        <p>In this chapter, one will learn some basic operations in Tableau to get acquainted with its interface. 
                                        There are three basic steps involved in creating any Tableau data analysis report.</p>
                                        <p>These three steps are −</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Connect to a data source − It involves locating the data and using an appropriate type of 
                                            connection to read the data.</li>
                                            <li>Choose dimensions and measures − This involves selecting the required columns from the 
                                            source data for analysis.</li>
                                            <li>Apply visualization technique − This involves applying required visualization methods, such as 
                                            a specific chart or graph type to the data being analyzed.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>For convenience, let’s use the sample data set that comes with Tableau installation named sample –
                                            superstore.xls. Locate the installation folder of Tableau and go to My Tableau Repository. Under it,
                                            you will find the above file at Datasources\9.2\en_US-US.</p>

                                            <p><b>Connect to a Data Source</b>
                                                <br><br>
                                                On opening Tableau, you will get the start page showing various data sources. Under the header
                                                “Connect”, you have options to choose a file or server or saved data source. Under Files, choose excel.
                                                Then navigate to the file “Sample – Superstore.xls” as mentioned above. The excel file has three
                                                sheets named Orders, People and Returns. Choose Orders.</p>


                                                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 02.07.07.png" width="100%"/></p>


                                                <p>Choose the Dimensions and Measures
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Next, choose the data to be analyzed by deciding on the dimensions and measures. Dimensions are
                                                    the descriptive data while measures are numeric data. When put together, they help visualize the
                                                    performance of the dimensional data with respect to the data which are measures. Choose Category
                                                    and Region as the dimensions and Sales as the measure. Drag and drop them as shown in the
                                                    following screenshot. The result shows the total sales in each category for each region.</p>

                                                    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 02.08.15.png" width="100%"/></p>

                                                    <p>Apply Visualization Technique
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        In the previous step, one can see that the data is available only as numbers. One has to read and
                                                        calculate each of the values to judge the performance. However, one can see them as graphs or
                                                        charts with different colors to make a quicker judgment.
                                                        <br>
                                                        We drag and drop the sum (sales) column from the Marks tab to the Columns shelf. The table showing
                                                        the numeric values of sales now turns into a bar chart automatically.</p>

                                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 02.12.40.png" width="100%"/></p>


                                                    <p>One can add another dimension to the existing data. This will add more colors to the existing bar chart
                                                        as shown in the following screenshot.</p>

                                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../Analytics/pics/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 02.13.08.png" width="100%"/></p>

                                                        <p>Now, one will get acquainted with various navigational features available in Tableau interface. When
                                                            running Tableau desktop, one will get the menu at the top which shows all the commands we can
                                                            navigate. On opening a blank workbook, you can go through the various important features under
                                                            each menu.
                                                            <br><br>
                                                            Menu Commands
                                                            <br><br>
                                                            When one closes the getting started window, one gets the main interface with all the available Menu
                                                            commands. They represent all the features available in Tableau. Different sections of the menu are
                                                            shown in the following diagram. Next, you can observe some details of each menu.</p>

                                                    <h3>The Question?</h3>
                                                    <p>The question most of the beginners eventually come across is, with so many libraries available to 
                                                    perform analytics and run machine learning algorithms should I spend time in understanding the 
                                                    mathematics behind them</p>
                                                    <p>The answer to this question depends completely on your outlook and aim to learn analytics.</p>
                                                    <p>If you want to learn ML not for the sake of learning it but to use it in order to solve another problem of 
                                                    interest, then there’s no need at all to dig deep into math. You can just use existing libraries like 
                                                    scikit-learn, keras, etc. To give you an analogy, this is basically like using Wordpress to create a 
                                                    website: if the reason why you’re building the website is what’s important to you, then don’t worry 
                                                    about learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.</p>
                                                    <p>You must know that ML algorithms are not created out of a vacuum: they are a direct result of how 
                                                    their respective problems are modeled mathematically. For example, <strong>back-propagation algorithm</strong> is 
                                                    the direct result of applying the chain-rule (that one learns in multivariate calculus) to neural nets, or 
                                                    the <strong>K-means algorithm</strong> is nothing but alternating minimization applied to a constrained matrix 
                                                    factorization problem.</p>
                                                    <p>In short, you cannot avoid the ‘mathematics’ if you want to be more than just an end-user of ML.</p>
